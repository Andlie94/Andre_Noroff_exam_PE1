The task of this project was to create and set up a website for a fictional firm by my own chose. so I made up a firm called Stifinneren
## Description
In this project, we were tasked with setting up a functional blog for a fictional company of our choice. I decided to create a website called Stifinneren. This is a site aimed at children and young people interested in nature and hiking in the forest. I wanted to create a site for kids and hiking because I feel that most Norwegian sites are targeted at adults or older people.

For this project, we created blog posts that are sent from an API. We also built a login function and a user registration feature, using JavaScript. Additionally, we created an "edit" page that allows admins to write new blog posts, edit existing posts, and delete old posts. In this project, only the admin user can delete, edit, or create new posts, as I didn't want anyone to accidentally delete everything on the site. Once logged in, users can explore the entire website.

For this project, we used Figma to design the layout, HTML to set up the structure, CSS to style the website, and JavaScript to make it interactive.
+ Design: make a visual design in figma
+ HTML: Build a webpage by using HTML to structure the projects.
+ CSS: to style the webpage, like fonts, color etc.
+ JavaScript to make it interactive
+ Responsive design: this is to make sure that the website works on different sizes(mobile, web, pad).
